## Interesting topics

### Versioning

Binary compatibilty, JVM versions, Scala library versions, cross-compilation

Q: What if we cross-compile a library against two Scala versions, but the standard libraries are different at a relevant point?

### Performance

Benchmarking, boxing, `map` implementation.

Q: Can we improve performance using tagged types / refined types / etc? (Because we need to do less runtime checks.)

### Compiler internals

Macros, plugins, TASTy

### Types

ClassTag/Manifest

### Implicits

Implementation in class files

### ScalaJS

### ScalaNative

### Scala 3
